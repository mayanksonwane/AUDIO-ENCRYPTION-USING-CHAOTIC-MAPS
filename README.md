1. Introduction
Audio encryption is a technique used to transmit secure information. This ensures audio security between sender and receiver. With the rapid growth of communication technology and with the increasing use of audio communication in various fields, including teleconferencing, broadcasting and music distribution, the need for secure audio communication has become more critical. However, traditional encryption methods such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Blowfish have limitations in terms of security and performance.

To address these limitations, various encryption techniques are used so that data is not leaked and misused. One of the methods to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of the audio data is audio encryption using chaotic map. In the first stage, chaos maps are used to perform dynamic audio signal diffusion, which shuffles the audio samples to make it difficult for an attacker to recover the original signal. In the second stage, the audio samples are converted to DNA sequences and encrypted using a secret key, providing an additional layer of security.

2. Literature Review
The scheme utilizes a chaotic system with a changeable multi-scroll to generate a key stream to confuse and diffuse audio data. Effectiveness has been evaluated using statistical analysis. The results demonstrate that the scheme is effective in fast audio encryption, and it can also be applied to encrypting audio with more channels. The proposed scheme provides a high level of security and is resistant to brute-force attacks.[1] 

Provides a comprehensive overview of various chaos-based image encryption methods. Depending on the type of chaotic map used, such as logistic map, tent map, and Lorentz map, various chaos-based image encryption methods are considered and classified. Evaluate the effectiveness of the considered method using various indicators such as encryption speed, key sensitivity, reliability and security.[2]
A new image encryption method combining logistic map and 2D-TCLM. The encryption method divides a plaintext image into non-overlapping 8x8 blocks, encrypts each block using a logistic map and 2D-TCLM, and then combines the encrypted blocks to form an encrypted image. The results show that the method provides a high level of security, good performance, and resistance against various attacks such as brute force attack, statistical attack, and differential attack.[3]

3. Problem Statement
With the increasing use of audio communication in various fields, the security of audio transmission has become a major concern. Traditional encryption methods such as AES and Blowfish have security and performance limitations that can make them vulnerable to attack. So, there is a need of more secure and efficient audio encryption method.

4. Objectives 
The objective of this project is to develop an audio encryption system using two chaotic map based dynamic diffusion technique and double DNA encoding to ensure maximum security and confidentiality of the audio data. Aim of the project is to create a robust encryption algorithm that can resist various types of attacks while maintaining the quality of the audio.
